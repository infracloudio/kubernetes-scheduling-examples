# Kubernetes-Scheduling-Examples
Kubernetes provides advance scheduling mechanisms to give you a greater control over how your pods are scheduled. Below is the detailed overview along with the hands on labs to get to started.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have a working kubernetes multi-node cluster and that kubectl is properly configured to access it.
